This is a GUI application that lets you download anime episodes from Crunchyroll and HIDIVE.

### Features:
- Download anime episodes in mp4 format, and specify a quality (1080p, 720p, 480p, etc.)
- Download episodes with soft subtitles in mkv format
- Download the audio of an episode in mp3 format
- Download the m3u8 playlist (very fast, and still playable with the VLC player)
- Download all of the episode thumbnails in png format
- Download the subtitles of an episode (ass or vtt)
- Download all of the episodes in a season (detected by the link or if the search query has no numbers)
- If you have a premium account you can login to download premium episodes
- Use the web browser to download directly from the website
- Control the conversion process (pause, resume, stop, delete, etc.)

### Searching
The application attempts to search for the provided anime, so to download Konosuba for example you can simply type "konosuba". This downloads all episodes, to download a specific episode append a number, ex. "konosuba 1" only downloads the first episode. To download episodes 2-4, you can type "konosuba 2-4". 

This doesn't work for every anime, so for the highest accuracy you can provide a direct link. Links to a specific episode and links to the page of the anime are supported. If you provide a link to the anime page, you can also append a number to download a specific episode range.

Update: Searching with a query isn't supported anymore.

### Output Template

You can specify a custom output path. The default is `{seasonTitle} {episodeNumber}`. Adding slashes will create sub-folders, ex. `{seriesTitle}/{seasonTitle}/{episodeTitle}`. These are the available replacements:

{seasonTitle} - The title of the season \
{episodeTitle} - The title of the episode \
{seriesTitle} - The title of the series (ex. The series of SAO II is "Sword Art Online") \
{episodeNumber} - The number of the episode \
{resolution} - The resolution (ex. "1080p"). Only available for video formats. \
{language} - The language (ex. "English").

### Advanced Video Options

**Video Quality** - A value from 0-51 where 0 is lossless and 51 is very poor quality. Setting this too low has diminishing returns because it wonâ€™t be very noticeable but the filesize would become huge. The recommended range is between 17-28. 

**Video Codec** - Different video coding formats have a different filesize to quality ratios and different computational times. The approximate sizes are for a 720p video. These are the supported codecs:

No Re-Encoding - Original video, huge filesize. (Approx. size - 730MB) \
H.264 - Worst quality to filesize ratio, but fastest. (Approx. size - 180MB) \
H.265 - Best quality and smallest filesize, but has little support. (Approx. size - 120MB) \
VP8 - Good quality, small filesize, but slowest. *Setting the codec to VP8 will also force the output format to be WEBM*. (Approx. size - 130MB) \
VP9 - Better quality and faster than VP8. (Approx. size - 190MB)

### CDM

To download videos from Crunchyroll you have to download a CDM and place the files `device_private_key` and `device_client_id_blob` into the ffmpeg folder. You can find the folder in the location where the app is installed. I won't distribute these files but you can find guides on how to get them online.

### Installation

Download the latest installer from the [releases](https://github.com/Tenpi/Crunchyroll-Downloader/releases) tab.

### Bugs and Requests

You can open an issue on my GitHub repository

### Important

You may only use this for personal usage/offline viewing only. If you like anime then support the industry by buying merch, DVD's, CR premium, etc. You will need to have an active subscription to download most content.
